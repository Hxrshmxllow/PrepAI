The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don&rsquo;t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected office). Because researchers aren&rsquo;t able to influence who wins elections, they&rsquo;re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group.

The text explains that fan cells&mdash;a type of brain cell&mdash;are necessary for the acquisition of new associative memories, and that activity among these cells requires a chemical known as dopamine, which the brain produces in response to rewards. Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual&rsquo;s capacity to form associative memories. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual&rsquo;s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things. Choice D is incorrect because the text never discusses how fan cells are initially created and therefore provides no evidence for a conclusion about how receiving a reward would affect their creation.&nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that weaken the student&rsquo;s conclusion about the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards. The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student&rsquo;s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is &ldquo;entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,&rdquo; meaning that the spider population wouldn&rsquo;t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student&rsquo;s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn&rsquo;t weaken the student&rsquo;s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren&rsquo;t the only cause of the reduction.&nbsp;</p>",

As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California&rsquo;s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California&rsquo;s coast.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California&rsquo;s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad&rsquo;s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California&rsquo;s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad&rsquo;s \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned.

The text describes an experiment by Eva Ka&scaron;tovsk&aacute; and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Ka&scaron;tovsk&aacute; and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what&rsquo;s important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn&rsquo;t change&mdash;that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn&rsquo;t address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that the trend of admirable-trait candidates being rated as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates held true when participants&rsquo; own personality-trait scores were factored in, except among participants with high ignobility scores. The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants&rsquo; own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants&rsquo; ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates&rsquo; likability ratings (as participants&rsquo; ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates&rsquo; likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates&rsquo; likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants&rsquo; ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion. The conclusion isn&rsquo;t just that participants gave different ratings to the two types of candidates&mdash;it&rsquo;s that participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores specifically gave higher likability ratings to admirable-trait candidates than to ignoble-trait candidates and that participants with high ignobility scores didn&rsquo;t.</p>",

The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named &lsquo;Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from &lsquo;Oumuamua&rsquo;s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within &lsquo;Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: &lsquo;Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues&rsquo; claim.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from &lsquo;Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of &lsquo;Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: &lsquo;Oumuamua&rsquo;s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner&rsquo;s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to &lsquo;Oumuamua, but the text states that &lsquo;Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.</p>",

The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that <em>fabula</em> and <em>syuzhet</em> can&rsquo;t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning.

The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited.

Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging&rsquo;s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low&mdash;meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega&rsquo;s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn&rsquo;t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe&mdash;nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn&rsquo;t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.</p>",

The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure.

The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the plant <em>Arabidopsis</em> <em>thaliana</em>, half of which were exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a control group without exposure to kanamycin, and measured the plants\u2019 metal content five days after germination. </p>",

The text indicates that <em>The Books of Jacob</em> has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering.

Although the word &ldquo;accuracy,&rdquo; or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether Tokarczuk&rsquo;s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because &ldquo;inactivity&rdquo; means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk&rsquo;s novel, and although it&rsquo;s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to describe the novel itself as such.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because in this context &ldquo;restraint&rdquo; would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Tokarczuk&rsquo;s novel has either of these qualities.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros&rsquo;s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character&rsquo;s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn&rsquo;t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren&rsquo;t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella&rsquo;s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren&rsquo;t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that <em>The House on Mango Street</em> has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn&rsquo;t relate directly to the text&rsquo;s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Stree</em>t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros&rsquo;s novella, such similarities wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how <em>The House on Mango Street</em> had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence.&nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language&rsquo;s speakers don&rsquo;t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language).&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country&rsquo;s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya&rsquo;s total population can be inferred from the table&mdash;if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people&mdash;nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya&rsquo;s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn&rsquo;t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their first language or a subsequent language.&nbsp;</p>",

Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900&ndash;1600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar&mdash;a species whose range doesn&rsquo;t extend to Missouri.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Fairfield Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it&rsquo;s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar&rsquo;s range didn&rsquo;t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget&rsquo;s artist likely wouldn&rsquo;t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar&rsquo;s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget&rsquo;s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE. The actions of contemporary artists cannot provide evidence for centuries-old networks of artistic influence and exchange.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that the transition from a stagnant lid regime to a tectonic plate regime occurred around 3.2 billion years ago. The text explains that early in Earth&rsquo;s history, Earth exhibited a stagnant lid regime in which there&rsquo;s no interaction between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. The text further explains that, by contrast, once Earth began to exhibit a tectonic plate regime, its lithospheric and mantle material began to mix. If mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain material not found in older mantle-derived rocks, that material must have originated somewhere other than the mantle. And if this material is found in both older and contemporaneous lithospheric rocks, that would imply that the lithosphere was able to mix with mantle material beginning around 3.2 billion years ago, as the researchers concluded.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text gives no basis for comparing the quantities of lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives no basis for comparing the material makeup of lithospheric rocks to that of mantle-derived rocks. Choice C is incorrect. A positive correlation between the age of lithospheric rocks and these rocks&rsquo; chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks would mean that the oldest rocks would be the most similar, which contradicts the text&rsquo;s claim that lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks were completely separate until 3.2 billion years ago. If the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about the onset of tectonics on Earth is correct, then younger lithospheric rocks would show greater chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks than older lithospheric rocks do.</p>",

The first sentence explains that reproducing the high ridership of Mexico City&rsquo;s public transit system in other cities by implementing some of its features, such as its low fares, is unlikely to guarantee significant ridership increases in those cities. The following sentence introduces a study by Guerra et al., whose findings&mdash;namely that choice of transportation mode in urban centers in Mexico is influenced by a variety of local contextual factors&mdash;support this claim. The first part of the last sentence concedes that features of transportation systems likely do have some effect on ridership numbers, but the underlined portion reiterates the study&rsquo;s conclusion by stating that there is an \"irreducibly contextual dimension\" to peoples&rsquo; choice to use public transportation: that is, there is a complex mix of local contextual factors&mdash;including population density, spatial distribution of jobs, and demographics&mdash;whose influence over an urban center&rsquo;s transit ridership is unique to each location, and it is unlikely that simple changes to transit system characteristics could negate the influence of those contextual factors. Thus, the underlined portion explains why it is challenging to influence transit ridership solely by changing some of a transit system&rsquo;s characteristics.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Rather than objecting to the argument of Guerra et al., the underlined portion reiterates their argument by stating that there is an \"irreducibly contextual dimension\" involved in transportation mode choice; in other words, transportation mode choice in urban areas of Mexico is strongly dependent on contextual factors that are unique to each urban area. Choice C is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the text&rsquo;s central claim, which is that transit ridership is the product of a complex mix of contextual factors and transit system features, not that a characteristic associated with Mexico City&rsquo;s high transit ridership was found to have no association with high transit ridership elsewhere. Additionally, the underlined portion does not illustrate a claim, but instead restates the findings of Guerra et al. Choice D is incorrect. Although Guerra et al. demonstrate that population density, the spatial distribution of jobs, and demographic characteristics&mdash;factors that comprise the \"contextual dimension of transportation mode choice\"&mdash;influence transit ridership, the underlined portion does not substantiate&mdash;that is, provide evidence in support of&mdash;this assertion.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Bastos&rsquo;s study of a wild kea parrot. In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos&rsquo;s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos&rsquo;s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos&rsquo;s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics&rsquo; opinion regarding the kea&rsquo;s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea&rsquo;s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics&rsquo; opinion in this context must be that the kea&rsquo;s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos&rsquo;s claim that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea&rsquo;s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea&rsquo;s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea&rsquo;s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.</p>",

The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru&rsquo;s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located.

Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, not strengthen it.

The text begins by pointing out an obstacle to observing the astronomical phenomenon of the NCP: the NCP is visible only at night. The text then indicates that, inspired by the ability of some insects and birds to navigate using visualizations of polarized sunlight, researchers devised a way to locate the NCP during daylight. The text then indicates that the researchers mimicked the insects&rsquo; and birds&rsquo; polarized-light visualization capabilities using a polarimetric camera. Thus, the text notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of certain animals that inspired a solution to that obstacle, and then explains how researchers used an optical device to mimic that ability.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate this is the case, let alone that the NCP is relevant to a majority of navigational tools. Furthermore, the text doesn&rsquo;t state that researchers discovered that insects and birds navigate without the NCP; rather, it indicates that it&rsquo;s known that some animals navigate by using skylight polarization to locate the NCP during the day and that this knowledge inspired the method the researchers devised. Choice B is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn&rsquo;t state that this is the case. Furthermore, the text discusses how some animals&rsquo; use of navigational strategies based on the same celestial occurrence served as the inspiration for the researchers&rsquo; polarized-light approach, not as the basis for a comparison of the relative effectiveness of animal and human methods of navigation. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that humans have typically been able to locate the NCP visually at night and indicates that some animals use the NCP to navigate, the text doesn&rsquo;t state that humans use the NCP for navigation. The text therefore doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between how humans and animals use the NCP for this purpose. Furthermore, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that existing navigational instruments will be augmented with polarimetric technologies.</p>",

Although such a finding might help explain why shark abundance has declined, it would reveal nothing about whether the shark decline is related to the oyster decline.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because a finding that eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater when dusky sharks and cownose rays are present than when only dusky sharks are present wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren&rsquo;t keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays&rsquo; predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn&rsquo;t bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because a finding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Such a finding would suggest that some factor other than shark abundance led to an increase in rays&rsquo; consumption of oysters and thus to a decrease in oyster abundance, thereby weakening the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis.&nbsp;</p>",

The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don&rsquo;t sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers&rsquo; claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold&mdash;even if those profits are earned less frequently and don&rsquo;t support weekly loan payments.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn&rsquo;t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn&rsquo;t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors&mdash;meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn&rsquo;t depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn&rsquo;t affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don&rsquo;t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence&rsquo;s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn&rsquo;t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds&rsquo; nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it&rsquo;s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds&rsquo; reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they&rsquo;ve hatched.&nbsp;</p>",

In the text, the narrator describes himself as \"excited.\" Although excitement is a positive emotion, it isn&rsquo;t as intensely positive as feeling overjoyed is. Moreover, the narrator also notes that he felt \"scared.\" In other words, his excitement (a positive emotion) is balanced with fear (a negative emotion). Given this mixture of positive and negative emotions, it would be inaccurate to characterize the narrator as overjoyed. Choice B is incorrect because in the text, the narrator describes himself as having felt both fear and excitement. Neither of these emotions can be thought of as peaceful and, in fact, are almost the opposite of a sense of peace. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the narrator describes himself as both \"scared\" and \"excited,\" not angry and jealous.</p>",

The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn&rsquo;t initially plan to write a story only &ldquo;focusing on the meeting itself&rdquo; but rather had considered writing a &ldquo;much longer&rdquo; and more expansive work about the meeting&rsquo;s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film&rsquo;s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn&rsquo;t specify to what extent Powers&rsquo;s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened. Rather, the quotation focuses on Powers&rsquo;s description of the film&rsquo;s basic premise and how the characters engage with the historical context of its setting. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza&rsquo;s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn&rsquo;t move linearly, going \"on and on, from one thing to the next,\" but instead moves circularly, \"like the hands of a clock.\" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day \"following the same path.\" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly \"disturbed [Karenin&rsquo;s] sense of time,\" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin&rsquo;s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin&rsquo;s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin&rsquo;s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs&rsquo; circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be \"plotted on a straight line.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"&mdash;that is, always in a regular and predictable way.</p>",

The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author&rsquo;s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student&rsquo;s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because&nbsp;the student&rsquo;s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student&rsquo;s claim is about why the explanatory notes were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers&rsquo; and critics&rsquo; subsequent experience of the poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn&rsquo;t directly address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes specifically to make them useful to the marketing of the stand-alone volume. </p>",

The table indicates that Edwin Carewe was active from 1912 to 1934, meaning that his 47 credited acting roles were in films made before or during 1934, not after that time. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t effectively exemplify the idea that the film outputs of the four individuals included in the table should be considered bare minimums. Instead of addressing the idea that the individuals likely had higher outputs than those recorded, this choice suggests that James Young Deer actually acted in and directed fewer films than presented in the table (only 33 known films as a director instead of 35, and only 10 known films as an actor instead of 33). </p>",

Difference in cell size results in a construction problem&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells&mdash;that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student&rsquo;s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn&rsquo;t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn&rsquo;t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a <em>higher </em>percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.</p>",

The text makes this claim based on the fact that ancient trade routes connected Puerto Rico with Colombia but not with Peru. However, if it&rsquo;s true that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were genetically less similar to ancient guinea pigs in Colombia than to ancient guinea pigs in Peru, this would suggest that the Puerto Rican guinea pigs didn&rsquo;t descend from Colombian guinea pigs.

While a finding about how common guinea pig imagery is in ancient Puerto Rican art would indicate the cultural significance of guinea pigs, it wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to a claim about the geographical origin or descent of the guinea pig population on the island.

Choice C is incorrect because the finding that modern breeds of guinea pigs don&rsquo;t look like images of guinea pigs in ancient art from Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Peru wouldn&rsquo;t address the ancestral relationships between ancient guinea pig populations in these three regions.

The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (<em>P.</em> <em>miniata</em>) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star&rsquo;s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming \"headless\" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t identify how any particular region of sea stars&rsquo; bodies influences the layout of sea stars&rsquo; radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as \"known\") and doesn&rsquo;t address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars&rsquo; origin, Formery et al.&rsquo;s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is \"headless.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about <em>P. miniata</em> sea stars&rsquo; body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between <em>P. miniata </em>and <em>S. kowalevskii </em>acorn worms. The text indicates only that little or no activity was observed in certain types of genes associated with body development in <em>P. miniata</em>, not that those genes turned out to largely differ from body-development genes in <em>S. kowalevskii</em>.</p>",

The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain&rsquo;s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony&rsquo;s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can influence how a language develops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether.

If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s&mdash;during most of Morrison&rsquo;s time working there&mdash;than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House&rsquo;s published authors, thus supporting the scholar&rsquo;s claim. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company&rsquo;s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison&rsquo;s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn&rsquo;t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison&rsquo;s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar&rsquo;s claim focuses on Morrison&rsquo;s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison&rsquo;s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists&rsquo; claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program&rsquo;s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists&rsquo; claim about the program&rsquo;s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program&rsquo;s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well.</p>",

The text indicates that there is a long-standing trend of overemphasizing teenagers and young adults in social media research.  Expanding the focus of social media research to include senior citizens, as the text indicates scholars have begun to do, could help to rectify the trend, but it could not prevent the trend or make the trend impossible in advance, since the trend started long before scholars started expanding their focus.</p>",

The text goes on to say that while it is &ldquo;not inconceivable that <em>Beowulf</em> emerged from such a context&rdquo;&mdash;that is, it is possible that <em>Beowulf</em> was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries&mdash;there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century.

In other words, the text suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem&rsquo;s fit with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text says that scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for the linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier, not that the evidence those scholars cite in favor of their view is unreliable or that anyone has cast doubt on that evidence. In other words, the text does not suggest that there are problems with the evidence cited by advocates of the later composition date, only that there is other evidence of an earlier composition date that those advocates need to consider.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that those scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries are giving priority to a controversial view of the social conditions at that time. The text makes no reference to any controversy about how scholars interpret that historical period. Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem on the basis of its fit with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how well the poem fits the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it fits that historical context as well as it fits the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries.

The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins.

Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin&rsquo;s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to &ldquo;new analysis,&rdquo; which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Minoan bull-leaping rituals. In this context, \"defend\" means support in the face of argument. The overall focus of the text is on the difficulty of determining what bull-leaping rituals meant to the Minoans, about whom, the text indicates, we know very little. The text states that because of this scarcity of information, assertions about the meaning of the rituals, which took place a very long time ago (in the second millennium BCE), are highly likely to be based on speculation and guesswork. This context suggests that claims about the meaning of the rituals are difficult to successfully support, or defend.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"imagine\" in this context would mean form a mental image of something. Although it&rsquo;s possible to imagine what Minoan bull-leaping rituals might have looked like, the focus of the text isn&rsquo;t on how the rituals looked but rather on claims about them, which the text suggests are difficult to support because very little is known about the Minoans. Choice B is incorrect because \"summarize\" in this context would mean recap or outline, neither of which makes sense. The text indicates that claims about the significance of Minoan bull-leaping rituals will inevitably rely on speculation and guesswork because very little is known about the Minoans. This suggests that claims about the Minoan rituals are difficult to support in the face of argument, not that they&rsquo;re difficult to recap or outline. Choice D is incorrect because \"adjust\" in this context would mean modify or correct. Although a claim about a ritual&rsquo;s meaning could be modified or corrected based on newly discovered evidence, the text doesn&rsquo;t focus on any specific claims made about the significance of Minoan bull-leaping rituals. Rather, the text focuses on the feasibility of making valid claims about the rituals in general, suggesting that the scarcity of information about the Minoans makes it difficult to support any claims about the rituals.</p>",

Text 1 discusses painter Edgar Degas&rsquo;s insistence that his works remain in their original painted frames, which contrasted with the gold frames that were typical of the Paris art scene at the time. The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire \"to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\" Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters \"placed their works in painted frames\" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that \"the frame&rsquo;s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting.\" Though differing on Impressionist painters&rsquo; rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn&rsquo;t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to \"harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting,\" implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas&rsquo;s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters&rsquo; attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1&rsquo;s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso&rsquo;s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes El Paso as a particularly rich site for Spanish-language journalism in the late 1800s, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether newspapers published in El Paso influenced the newspapers published in other cities across Texas, including San Antonio. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t mention whether Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas were also widely read in Mexico. The text only focuses on the popularity of Spanish-language newspapers within Texas, and especially in El Paso.</p>",

Text 1 describes Sharif&rsquo;s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction.

The graph shows that in 2010, the number of computer services jobs was approximately 6,000, which is the same approximate number of jobs in engineering services. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of jobs in technical consulting services and the number of jobs in computer services were about the same, at approximately 5,000.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the graph shows that in 2010 the number of computer services jobs (about 6,000) was higher than the number of  technical consulting services jobs (about 4,000), in 2019 the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not about the same as the number of engineering services jobs (about 6,000). Choice C is incorrect because according to the graph, the number of jobs in computer services was lower than the number of jobs in engineering services in 2019, not 2010. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not higher than the number of jobs in engineering services (about 6,000). Choice D is incorrect because the graph shows that the number of computer services jobs was about the same as the number of technical consulting services jobs in 2019, not 2010. This also means the number of computer services jobs could not have been lower than the technical consulting services jobs in 2019 if they were about the same.</p>",

The text states that Boeri&rsquo;s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics&rsquo; concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale&rsquo;s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.</p>",

    "stimulus": "<p>Jazz tap is a dance form that was first developed in African American communities. Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music&rsquo;s quick rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it. Because of jazz music&rsquo;s influence, jazz tap quickly developed into a dance form that was very different from earlier kinds of tap dance.</p>",

The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can \"exceed,\" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can \"encompass,\" or enclose or encircle, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can \"conceal,\" or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel.

The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes&rsquo; antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team&rsquo;s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes&rsquo; antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes.</p>",

The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

The text&rsquo;s description of Green&rsquo;s enthusiastic praise for the 2019 production suggests that he found this version more enjoyable, not less enjoyable, than the 2016 version, which he described as \"very confusing.\"</p>",

The first sentence of the text establishes that scientists didn&rsquo;t know much about the ocean floor in the 1950s. The second sentence, which is underlined, describes what many scientists thought at the time&mdash;that the ocean floor was mostly flat. The remainder of the text establishes that the ocean floor is far from flat, citing research conducted by Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen. Thus, the purpose of the underlined sentence is to identify a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed to be wrong.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Tharp and Heezen&rsquo;s work with sonar data in the Atlantic Ocean is mentioned later in the text, the underlined sentence doesn&rsquo;t describe the design of their experiment. Instead, it identifies a belief held by scientists that Tharp and Heezen demonstrated to be wrong. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence presents a belief held by many scientists in the 1950s; nowhere does the text mention a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen, whom the text describes as research partners working together to map the ocean floor.

This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is &ldquo;involuntarily framing advertisements&rdquo; (meaning that she can&rsquo;t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new &ldquo;situations&rdquo; (or jobs) would be like.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane&rsquo;s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall.

Prospero confirms this (\"thou hadst\") and then asks what else she can recall, stating that because she remembers one thing from the time before she lived on the island (\"ought ere thou camest here\"), she might also remember arriving on the island (\"how thou camest here\").

Further, Prospero doesn&rsquo;t suggest that he believes Miranda is discontent in her current circumstances. Choice B is incorrect. Although Miranda suggests some doubt about her recollection of a place other than the island, in that she describes it as \"like a dream\" she can&rsquo;t be certain of, Prospero doesn&rsquo;t mention her uncertainty&mdash;though he himself wonders how it is possible that she correctly recalls something from so long ago (\"abysm of time\"). Rather than indicating that doubt is making Miranda reluctant, Prospero simply states that Miranda may have the ability to remember traveling to the island. Choice D is incorrect. Although Miranda describes a vague impression of several people who cared for her as a young child and states that it is \"rather like a dream\" instead of something she is certain is real, Prospero doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Miranda is remembering a childhood daydream.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years&mdash;1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees&mdash;grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.&nbsp;</p>",

There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn&rsquo;t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers.

The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benefits, having deeply saturated feathers is usually &ldquo;an honest signal&rdquo; (a true indication) that a bird is generally fit. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven&rsquo;t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren&rsquo;t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager&rsquo;s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird&rsquo;s overall fitness.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers&rsquo; feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness.

Since there&rsquo;s no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there&rsquo;s no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that certain male tanagers may appear to be fitter than they actually are, not that scientists haven&rsquo;t determined why tanagers prefer mates with colorful appearances.&nbsp;</p>",

According to the text, Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today&rsquo;s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to find Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren&rsquo;t mentioned, there&rsquo;s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today&rsquo;s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>is thematically accessible to today&rsquo;s audiences, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is more accessible than Shakespeare&rsquo;s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies hold continued appeal for today&rsquo;s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare&rsquo;s other works. </p>",

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of <em>T.</em> <em>navigans</em> based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons&mdash;namely, that <em>T. navigans</em> had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of <em>T. navigans</em>, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that <em>T. navigans</em> had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make <em>T. navigans</em> different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, <em>T. navigans</em> likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that <em>T. navigans</em> would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that <em>T. navigans </em>had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old&mdash;much older than the Clovis people&rsquo;s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces&mdash;that they are human-made tools&mdash;that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group&rsquo;s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn&rsquo;t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group&rsquo;s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.</p>",

Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been flexible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally.

In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (&ldquo;communities that included esteemed individuals&rdquo;) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times.

According to the text, the researchers concluded that the concentration of precipitation into fewer events will trigger more irrigation but that this change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to an area&rsquo;s baseline concentration of annual precipitation. The data in this choice support the idea that more irrigation will be needed, but to support the rest of the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, additional data from the table are required to show that the increases in water use for irrigation will vary depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice D is incorrect because data in the table indicate no declines in water use for irrigation, showing only increases in the form of positive values.</p>",

The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside influences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that outside influences \"conclude,\" or end, the main character&rsquo;s work. The text states that many supporters of the main character&rsquo;s art \"demand its proliferation,\" not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that outside influences are \"evaluating,\" or judging the main character&rsquo;s work. According to the text, the main character&rsquo;s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character&rsquo;s work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead influencing its initial direction. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that outside influences \"select,\" or choose the main character&rsquo;s work.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text based on supporting data in the graph. The text indicates that in the fly <em>D. melanogaster</em>, <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em> are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested <em>D. melanogaster</em>&rsquo;s resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> and <em>A. sicerae</em> bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: <em>DptA</em> silenced (referred to as type A), <em>DptB</em> silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> correlates with <em>DptA</em> activity but not with <em>DptB</em> activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to <em>P. rettgeri</em>). The graph shows the post&ndash;<em>A. sicerae</em> infection results, which indicate that <em>DptB</em> activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas <em>DptA</em> activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when <em>DptA</em> activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when <em>DptB</em> activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with <em>DptA</em> activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that <em>DptB</em> may have developed as a specific defense against <em>A. sicerae</em>.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that <em>DptA</em> activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where <em>DptA</em> alone was silenced, <em>DptB</em> alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em>, which would be necessary to determine whether <em>DptA </em>conferred defense against <em>A. sicerae</em> in the presence of<em> DptB</em>. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: <em>P. rettgeri</em> and <em>A. sicerae</em>. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in <em>DptA</em> is associated with resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> while <em>DptB</em> activity is not, and that <em>DptB</em> activity is associated with resistance to <em>A. sicerae</em> while <em>DptA</em> is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em>. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em> silenced, or inactive.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support G&oacute;mez-Baham&oacute;n and her team&rsquo;s hypothesis about fork-tailed flycatchers. The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. G&oacute;mez-Baham&oacute;n and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional &ldquo;genetic and anatomical divergence&rdquo; between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies&rsquo; tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males&rsquo; tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn&rsquo;t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The finding that breeding habits haven&rsquo;t changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies. </p>",

For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it&rsquo;s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn&rsquo;t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn&rsquo;t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn&rsquo;t advantageous.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.&nbsp;</p>",

The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes.

Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer&rsquo;s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn&rsquo;t appear to contain any life. Fierer&rsquo;s team says that though this doesn&rsquo;t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer&rsquo;s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer&rsquo;s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer&rsquo;s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn&rsquo;t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer&rsquo;s team wouldn&rsquo;t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn&rsquo;t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn&rsquo;t detect them, but the author doesn&rsquo;t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer&rsquo;s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>",

Choice D is incorrect because it results in an illogical and confusing sentence. Using &ldquo;while&rdquo; in this way suggests that the number of jams available varied during the time in which some shoppers had twenty-four options and others had six. The sentence makes clear, however, that what follows &ldquo;varied&rdquo; is a description of the variation, not a separate, simultaneous occurrence. </p>",

This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations.

It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped &ldquo;aesthetic sense,&rdquo; or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as &ldquo;messy things&rdquo; and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne&rsquo;s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn&rsquo;t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla&rsquo;s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne&rsquo;s personality. </p>",

For Carson&rsquo;s album, dubbed a &ldquo;mixtap/e/ssay,&rdquo; peer review involved both scholars and rap artists. In combining elements of a mixtape album with scholarly essays that connect Carson&rsquo;s lyrics to historical and contemporary contexts for listeners both inside and outside academia, Carson&rsquo;s album helped redefine how scholarship is created and shared.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in <em>L. pertusa</em> coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph&rsquo;s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em>. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of <em>L. pertusa</em> declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the <em>L. pertusa</em> population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the <em>L. pertusa</em> decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral&rsquo;s decline near the Mauritanian coast.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in <em>L. pertusa</em> (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral&rsquo;s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral&rsquo;s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in <em>L. pertusa</em> than after&mdash;because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after&mdash;the graph doesn&rsquo;t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral&rsquo;s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em>. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn&rsquo;t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em> in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided. Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as &ldquo;especially promising&rdquo; and a sign of &ldquo;exciting progress&rdquo; in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR&rsquo;s function in humans isn&rsquo;t yet known, it&rsquo;s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1&rsquo;s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s observations about EGR in humans. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven&rsquo;t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t say that Text 1&rsquo;s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1&rsquo;s excitement as premature and overly optimistic.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that TMAO reduces water&rsquo;s compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species&rsquo; level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water&rsquo;s tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules&rsquo; tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water&rsquo;s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water&rsquo;s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.</p>",

such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed. Recently, however, economist Sandile Hlatshwayo analyzed trends in news reports to derive measures not only for general economic policy uncertainty but also for uncertainty related to specific areas of economic policy, like tax or trade policy. One revelation of her work is that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy, as in the case of the United Kingdom, where general economic policy uncertainty <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months&rsquo; work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer&rsquo;s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel&rsquo;s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel&rsquo;s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text&mdash;that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>",

The text indicates that, according to Purcell&rsquo;s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual&rsquo;s actions in relation to that individual&rsquo;s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell&rsquo;s analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual&rsquo;s actions are rooted in that person&rsquo;s position in the community and the actions&rsquo; effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action&rsquo;s effects and the individual&rsquo;s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text&rsquo;s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual&rsquo;s action is dependent on the action&rsquo;s effects on the community and the person&rsquo;s specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors&mdash;the other being the person&rsquo;s societal role&mdash;that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal regarding factors that affect urban land expansion (ULE). According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions&rsquo; relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal suggests that Region 1&rsquo;s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period. Thus, whereas the data suggest governments in Region 2 became more efficient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those governments became less efficient, not more.</p>",

According to the text, the researchers reached this conclusion because Izapa and the settlements are of the same age and configuration in that all have a pyramid to the north and a plaza to the south. Thus, the main idea of the text is that researchers have inferred that Izapa was related to the smaller settlements that surrounded it based in part on the similarity of their construction.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses a similarity between how structures in Izapa and nearby settlements are arranged, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the arrangement in Izapa is based on those of the nearby settlements. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions that residents of Izapa and its surrounding settlements may have performed the same cultural ceremonies, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss the ceremonies&rsquo; importance for the residents.

Additionally, while the text indicates that the discovery of the 41 smaller settlements surrounding Izapa was made in present-day Chiapas and thus may be of recent date, this is a detail in the text, not its main idea.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells&rsquo; efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor&rsquo;s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor&rsquo;s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about spray coating&rsquo;s potential value. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn&rsquo;t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating. </p>",

light into electricity more efficiently than earlier kinds of solar cells, and manufacturing advances have recently made them commercially attractive. One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. Andr\u00e9 Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to what the researchers mentioned in Text 1 contend. Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tectonics on Earth began. Text 1 also mentions researchers who contend that movements of tectonic plates began around 3 billion years ago. As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth&rsquo;s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence). Chowdhury and his team argue, based on this analysis, that tectonic plates may have begun to move as early as 4.2 billion years ago. Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.&rsquo;s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth&rsquo;s mantle and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t argue that the temperature of Earth&rsquo;s mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 claims that empirical evidence is needed to fix the earliest date of tectonic movement. Computer models are simulations, not empirical evidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t distinguish between different kinds of computer models but would instead argue that no computer models can reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t consider any computer model to be able to provide evidence to support a plausible claim about tectonic movement, no matter how much such models were improved. The author of Text 2 would only accept empirical evidence.</p>",

In this context, \"ambiguity\" means uncertainty or doubtfulness. The text explains that although skeptics had thought that direct evidence of gravitational waves would be too faint to be detected, researchers led by Gonz&aacute;lez claimed that a chirping sound captured by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory antennas nevertheless provided such evidence. The text goes on to say that detailed statistical analysis confirmed the observation of gravitational waves with a high degree of confidence&mdash;that is, with near certainty&mdash;a finding that helped to preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal&rsquo;s attribution to gravitational waves might be ambiguous or doubtful.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inconspicuousness\" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect. Although the text indicates that skeptics had doubted whether gravitational waves could be observed directly because of their presumed faintness (which suggests that gravitational waves were expected to be difficult to detect), the blank portion of the text isn&rsquo;t referring to the possibility that gravitational waves are unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is Gonz&aacute;lez&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s observation of a chirping sound that they attributed to gravitational waves, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that through statistical analysis, they ruled out the possibility that the sound they observed was undetectable. Rather, the skeptical view presented in the text suggests that there could be some ambiguity about the source of the chirping, but statistical analysis virtually eliminated this uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"discretion\" would mean good judgment, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that an event, such as the detection of gravitational waves, would show judgment, much less that the event&rsquo;s capacity to exercise good judgment would be precluded by statistical analysis confirming its attribution. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"probability\" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood.</p>",

The table contains information about the right ascensions, periods, and frequencies of various pulsar stars called RRATs. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is defined as the time between consecutive pulses. The table shows that the period of RRAT J0614-03 is 0.136 seconds, which is the lowest number of all the periods of the RRATs listed in the table. If the period is the time between consecutive pulses, and J0614-03 has the shortest period, then J0614-03 has the shortest amount of time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, J0545-03 has a period of 1.074 seconds and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses. Therefore, since J0545-03 and J0121+53 have different periods, they do not have the same amount of time between consecutive pulses. Choice C is incorrect because according to the table, J1654-2335 has a period of 0.545 seconds, which is not the longest period of all the RRATs listed in the table. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and both J0545-03 and J0121+53 have longer periods than J1654-2335, so J1654-2335 does not have the longest time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table. Choice D is incorrect because according to the table, J0103+54 has a period of 0.354 seconds, and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and only J0121+53 has more than one second of time between consecutive pulses, not J0103+54.</p>",

The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren&rsquo;t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can&rsquo;t be examples of true hedgehogs.

The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn&rsquo;t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.</p>",

Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse&rsquo;s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn&rsquo;t be sufficient.

It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of <em>Instant Mural</em>. According to the text, the 1974 work <em>Instant Mural</em> involved taping two Asco members (Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval) to an outdoor wall as a direct commentary on constraint (limitation or restriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on Valdez&rsquo;s role in the work and on social limitations women faced at the time&mdash;an approach that fails to explain the role of Sandoval, a man&mdash;people should consider that in 1974 (and long before) the art establishment limited recognition of Chicano artists to those who created murals with social and historical subjects, making it challenging for nonmuralist Chicano artists (such as Asco&rsquo;s members) to show their work. The text suggests that considering the situation with the art establishment leads to a conclusion that accounts for the fact that <em>Instant Mural</em> is explicitly about constraint and features both a woman and a man taped to the wall: <em>Instant Mural</em> isn&rsquo;t a reflection of the social constraints placed on women specifically but instead is a reflection on the constraining aesthetic expectations placed on Chicano artists in general (that is, the limits resulting from the lack of recognition of Chicano artists of any gender who did not create sociohistorical murals).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that the art establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did recognize Chicano muralists to the exclusion of other Chicano artists, so there&rsquo;s no reason to assume Asco&rsquo;s work <em>Instant Mural</em> was intended to represent Chicano muralists&rsquo; frustration; it&rsquo;s far more likely that Asco&rsquo;s members&mdash;described as Chicano nonmuralists&mdash;were representing their own frustration at being unrecognized by the art establishment. Choice B is incorrect. The text emphasizes that while a common approach to <em>Instant Mural</em> focuses on Valdez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails to account for the presence of a man in the work, there is a conclusion that explains Sandoval&rsquo;s role. But concluding that <em>Instant Mural</em> represents a double constraint experienced specifically by female Chicano artists would still fail to account for the inclusion of a man in the work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that <em>Instant Mural</em> can be understood as something other than a commentary on social constraints women faced in 1974, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the work is best understood as a critique of the content of any other artworks. The text doesn&rsquo;t address how Chicano culture is depicted in sociohistorical murals; it discusses such murals only to make the point that in 1974 (and earlier) the art establishment recognized Chicano artists who produced them to the exclusion of Chicano nonmuralists, indicating a constraint all of Asco&rsquo;s members faced, regardless of gender.</p>",

The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH<sub>3</sub> could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH<sub>3</sub> without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH<sub>3</sub> serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH<sub>3</sub> in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub>. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH<sub>3</sub> to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH<sub>3</sub> usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH<sub>3</sub> as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub> that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas.</p>",

The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services &ldquo;happened at very different rates in the two countries.&rdquo; This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US.

The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues&rsquo; experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of aptamers&rsquo; capacity to test for pathogens in food. The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn&rsquo;t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other <em>E. coli</em> strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for <em>E. coli</em>, and similarity between strains (of <em>E. coli</em> or of other pathogens) isn&rsquo;t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of <em>E. coli</em>, since Somvanshi et al.&rsquo;s paper turned purple when exposed to <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn&rsquo;t bind to different strains of <em>E. coli</em>. The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of <em>E. coli</em> (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of <em>E. coli</em>. In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low.</p>",

The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration.

Although it&rsquo;s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down.

The text indicates that Gidna, Yravedra, and Dom&iacute;nguez-Rodrigo compared the behaviors of wild lions in a national park with those of captive lions in a reserve. The text also establishes that the researchers were familiar with earlier studies showing that regularly offering food to captive animals reduces the need for cognitive engagement with the environment and can lead the animals to develop novel stereotypic behaviors, or new behaviors that are repetitive without a clear purpose. It follows, then, that the researchers weren&rsquo;t surprised to find that unlike the wild lions, the captive lions continued gnawing on the bones of provided carcasses even when the bones no longer provided nutrients, because this would be an example of captive animals developing a new and purposelessly repetitive behavior.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that the researchers&rsquo; findings were consistent with earlier findings that animals may develop novel stereotypic behaviors in captivity, and there&rsquo;s no reason to think that displaying aggression during feeding is a purposelessly repetitive behavior or that it was newly developed by lions in captivity, especially if the researchers found that wild lions also showed aggression during feeding. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the researchers&rsquo; findings were consistent with previous findings that novel stereotypic behaviors can develop when captive animals lack cognitive engagement with their environments. It therefore isn&rsquo;t logical to conclude that the researchers weren&rsquo;t surprised to find that captive lions engaged in repetitive behaviors in an environment with a cognitively demanding feeding system, especially if those behaviors were similar to those seen in wild lions, because that finding wouldn&rsquo;t be an example of a new behavior developing in captivity as a result of low cognitive engagement. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that the researchers&rsquo; findings were consistent with earlier findings that animals may develop new purposelessly repetitive behaviors in captivity. It isn&rsquo;t logical to conclude that the researchers weren&rsquo;t surprised to find that both captive and wild lions engage in stereotypic pacing before a feeding activity, since that finding would be an example of a repetitive behavior shared by wild and captive animals rather than one that newly developed in captivity.</p>",

The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels. Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don&rsquo;t cross. To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis. Such a finding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is incorrect because finding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn&rsquo;t a barrier to the sea stars. Choice D is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater mostly stayed near the bottom of the tank but sea stars in the other tank climbed into the layer of fresh water wouldn&rsquo;t support Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis.

The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker&rsquo;s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn&rsquo;t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience.

According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience.

Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.</p>",

The text indicates that researchers were exposing two groups of male bold jumping spiders (field-collected and laboratory-reared) to different stimuli and observing their subsequent behaviors. The text goes on to detail the observations made by the research team: field-collected spiders displayed aggressive behaviors when fed a high-protein diet and preferred flowers manipulated to display ultraviolet fluorescence, while laboratory-reared spiders displayed aggressive behaviors when fed a high-lipid diet and preferred nonfluorescent flowers that were dyed red. It can be inferred from the text that the rearing conditions (field versus laboratory) of the spiders was the independent variable for the experiment.

Additionally, the researchers observed the response of the spiders to different experimental stimuli, not the effect of rearing location on male spider aggression. Choice C is incorrect. The experiment detailed in the text compared two groups of bold jumping spiders reared in different settings&mdash;a lab setting, in which spiders were fed a high-lipid diet, and a field setting, in which spiders were fed a high-protein diet.

Although the experiment discussed in the text involved both lab-reared and field-collected specimens of the bold jumping spider, the text never suggests that lab-reared specimens were somehow superior to field-collected specimens or necessarily recommends the use of lab-reared specimens in experiments.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"&mdash;that is, comparatively very little&mdash;in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel&rsquo;s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there&rsquo;s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn&rsquo;t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t imply that graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written&mdash;that is, well crafted&mdash;as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted.</p>",

The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second.

The text indicates that &ldquo;until recently,&rdquo; superfluorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using &ldquo;thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,&rdquo; which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons. They also suggest that these polarons might absorb the thermal shocks that typically disrupt dipole synchronization at warmer temperatures. Thus, based on the text, Biliroglu and colleagues believe that polarons help dipoles synchronize at temperatures well above those at which superfluorescence had previously been observed. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t address the prospect of a superfluorescent burst moving between crystalline materials or any other mediums. Choice C is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superfluorescent bursts more likely to occur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts. Choice D is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would be no superfluorescence at room temperature. Thus, rather than decrease the intensity of superfluorescent bursts, polarons make them more likely to occur under certain circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms&rsquo; limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student&rsquo;s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn&rsquo;t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China&rsquo;s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn&rsquo;t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms&rsquo; assets&mdash;and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports&mdash;were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn&rsquo;t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn&rsquo;t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren&rsquo;t considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that it wasn&rsquo;t possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd&rsquo;a&scaron;tart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins&rsquo; weight.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon&rsquo;s financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised&mdash;that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade&mdash;likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it&rsquo;s unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren&rsquo;t considered suitable for trade, so Abd&rsquo;a&scaron;tart I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it&rsquo;s unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency.</p>",

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice C is incorrect.

The support needed would compare radial growth without adding nitrogen under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only the growth with and without nitrogen fertilization under moderate climate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.</p>",

According to the text, the student hypothesizes that <em>Brassica rapa parachinensis </em>(choy sum) will benefit more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modification being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were &ldquo;significantly taller&rdquo; than those in the more acidic mixture&mdash;an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is beneficial to the plants&rsquo; growth. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen the student&rsquo;s hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student&rsquo;s hypothesis that acidic soil benefits choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student&rsquo;s hypothesis that choy sum benefits from acidic soil. </p>",

Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices&mdash;including the farming of turkeys&mdash;to their new home. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley&rsquo;s terrain to that of Mesa Verde&rsquo;s terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Although genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande valley descended in part from the turkey population raised by the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde before their migration to the valley in 1280, this finding doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the possibility that Indigenous peoples living in the valley before 1280 might also have farmed turkeys. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region&mdash;the Rio Grande Valley&mdash;after 1280. </p>",

According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them&mdash;that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000&ndash;57,000 newtons and 35,000&ndash;63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000&ndash;235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000&ndash;34,000 newtons).

The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn&rsquo;t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson&rsquo;s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can&rsquo;t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don&rsquo;t support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates. </p>",

Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"a reprieve\" would be either a temporary relief from something or a delay of a punishment, neither of which would make sense as something that the duration of a gamma ray burst could provide to the burst itself.

The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut&rsquo;s reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"a superficial\" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut&rsquo;s reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut&rsquo;s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt.

If the likelihood, or probability, that a person will vote is linked to that person&rsquo;s level of political knowledge and interest, that would suggest that negatively affecting a person&rsquo;s level of political knowledge and interest would also negatively affect how likely that person is to vote.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text&rsquo;s discussion of lizard species&rsquo; use of maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%&ndash;39% of maximal speed, 40%&ndash;49% of maximal speed, 50%&ndash;59% of maximal speed, 60%&ndash;69% of maximal speed, 70%&ndash;79% of maximal speed, 80%&ndash;89% of maximal speed, and 90%&ndash;100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%&ndash;59%, 60%&ndash;69%, 70%&ndash;79%, and 80%&ndash;89%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn&rsquo;t organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%&ndash;100% (8 species total). However, these data don&rsquo;t complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don&rsquo;t complete the text&rsquo;s discussion of lizard species&rsquo; use of maximal speed when escaping predators.</p>",

The text explains that the LNH holds that there is an inverse relationship between the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity) and the grammatical complexity of that language&mdash;that is, that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity decreases, and vice versa. According to the text, Shcherbakova and colleagues focused on two positive indications of grammatical complexity&mdash;fusion and informativity&mdash;and analyzed their occurrence in over 1,300 languages. If the researchers found a slightly positive correlation between fusion and exotericity and between informativity and exotericity&mdash;meaning that to some extent, grammatical complexity increases as the number of non-native speakers of a language increases&mdash;their outcome would not be consistent with the assumption that exotericity and grammatical complexity are inversely related (the LNH).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to say that a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and both fusion and informativity is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH, since the finding would address only grammatical complexity (given that fusion and informativity are aspects of grammatical complexity) and wouldn&rsquo;t move beyond that factor to address its relationship to the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity), which is the relationship the LNH focuses on. Choice B is incorrect because a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity)&mdash;meaning that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity somewhat decreases, and vice versa&mdash;would be consistent, not inconsistent, with the LNH, since the text indicates that according to the LNH, there is an inverse relationship between grammatical complexity and exotericity; a negative correlation reflects an inverse relationship.

The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members.

Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create.

The text first provides Alice&rsquo;s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel&rsquo;s narrator.

Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; indicates that something is done too quickly.

According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn&rsquo;t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues&rsquo; perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it&rsquo;s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they&rsquo;re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals&rsquo; curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because this quotation would best support the student&rsquo;s assertion that the escape of transgenic fish from Brazilian fish farms into the wild may have significant negative long-term ecological effects. The text explains that transgenic fish have DNA that includes genetic material from other species, that some transgenic fish have genes from jellyfish that make them glow in the dark, and that glow-in-the-dark transgenic fish can now be found in the wild in Brazilian creeks. The quotation indicates why the escape of these fish may have negative long-term ecological effects: glow-in-the-dark transgenic fish might introduce fluorescence into wild fish populations by breeding with wild fish, causing wild fish to glow in the dark and thereby allowing predators to prey on them much more easily.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn&rsquo;t mention any negative effects of the introduction of fluorescent transgenic fish into the wild. The quotation merely compares the ratio of females to males at two sites in the wild where transgenic fish have been observed. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that the escape of fluorescent transgenic fish from Brazilian fish farms may have significant negative long-term ecological effects. Rather, the quotation suggests that more research is needed to understand the effects. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation supports the idea that transgenic fish may be present in more ecosystems than has been observed; it doesn&rsquo;t address whether the presence of fluorescent transgenic fish affects these ecosystems.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand. </p>",

The table presents the average time pollinators spent per floral morph. The data in the table shows that for pin flowers, the average time spent per flower by all pollinator genera was higher for flowers that had been artificially damaged than for intact flowers. By contrast, for thrum flowers, the difference in time spent on intact and damaged flowers is seen for only some pollinator genera.

The text introduces the concern that pteropods are thought to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, or lower pH levels, due to the susceptibility of their calcium carbonate shells to dissolution at lower pH levels. However, the text then describes findings from a recent study that suggest this concern may be unjustified, insofar as the protective periostracum coating on a pteropod&rsquo;s shell prevents dissolution, and even when the coating is breached, a pteropod can rebuild the inner shell wall, reducing the damage.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t call for additional research or suggest that more research is needed on biological mechanisms that improve pteropod survival rates. Instead, the text discusses a recent study showing that pteropods may not be as vulnerable to ocean acidification as is feared. Choice B is incorrect because the study discussed in the text doesn&rsquo;t address calcium carbonate&rsquo;s role in protecting the periostracum of pteropods. According to the text, the study addresses the periostracum&rsquo;s role in protecting pteropods&rsquo; calcium carbonate shells from dissolution due to ocean acidification. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t address how ocean acidification has altered pteropod behavior over time. Instead, the text focuses on the potential effects of ocean acidification on pteropods&rsquo; shells and the mechanisms protecting against those effects.</p>",

Text 1 begins by asserting that efforts to automate classification of paintings into different styles have been largely unsuccessful and that technological limits are likely to prevent significant success. Text 2 concedes that automated artistic style classifiers have found it difficult to distinguish between Baroque paintings and Renaissance paintings, but the text goes on to describe the work of Ravneet Singh Arora and Ahmed Elgammal, who have achieved a greater accuracy in classification by running one model on top of another. Text 2 concludes by describing Arora and Elgammal&rsquo;s approach as one that demonstrates that innovation is still possible in the field. Thus, the author of Text 2 would not agree with the underlined claim in Text 1 that the technological limits of automated painting classification models have been reached: instead, the author of Text 2 would emphasize that there are still advances being made in automated artistic style classification.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that its author would criticize previous research into automated artistic style classification systems for focusing on a narrow group of styles. Additionally, such a criticism, if it were present in Text 2, would not address the claim in the underlined sentence of Text 1, since Text 1&rsquo;s claim is concerned with the lack of success of automated classifiers and their technological limits, not with the focus of previous research into automated artistic style classification systems. Choice C is incorrect. While Text 1 does argue that differences between artistic styles are subjective, implying that two reasonable people might disagree about whether a painting is an example of one style or another, neither Text 1 nor Text 2 addresses whether most people can accurately identify the styles of paintings they are shown. Rather, both texts are concerned mainly with the potential accuracy of automated artistic style classifiers. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 provides no support for the assertion that its author would suggest that people may develop more uniform and accepted ideas regarding artistic classifications. Additionally, such a suggestion, if it were present in Text 2, would not address the claim in the underlined sentence of Text 1, since Text 1&rsquo;s claim is concerned with the lack of success of automated classifiers and their technological limits, not with the uniformity or acceptability of people&rsquo;s ideas about artistic styles and their boundaries.</p>",

The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place.

By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals&mdash;or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as &ldquo;a living showcase of San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Nikki Grimes&rsquo;s poetry collection <em>One Last Word</em>. The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes&rsquo;s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes&rsquo;s book. If the reviewers of <em>One Last Word</em> specifically note that the work is a &ldquo;beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,&rdquo; then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes&rsquo;s goal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a &ldquo;beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it.&rdquo; Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems &ldquo;to honor important Black poets of the past,&rdquo; so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes&rsquo;s goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they&rsquo;re among her favorite poets, this fact isn&rsquo;t suggested by the reviewers&rsquo; positive reaction to her book. Instead, the reaction suggests that Grimes was successful in her use of the golden shovel method.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether other writers were inspired by Grimes to use the golden shovel method in their poetry. The text mentions the poets Hughes and Johnson as examples of poets honored in Grimes&rsquo;s book and describes reviewers&rsquo; positive reception of her book, but it doesn&rsquo;t detail Grimes&rsquo;s impact on other writers. </p>",

As used in this context, &ldquo;confined to&rdquo; means restricted to. The text says that Vel&aacute;zquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because if Vel&aacute;zquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Vel&aacute;zquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone.

The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa&rsquo;s surface.

Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers&rsquo; trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue.

Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the first part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types. </p>",

Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses the presence of Near East dog breeds (and evidence of interbreeding with Siberian dogs) and artifacts like glass beads at Siberian sites starting about 2,000 years ago, suggesting only that the dogs and artifacts started to arrive in Siberia around that time. The text doesn&rsquo;t suggest the purpose of the arrival of the Near East dogs and artifacts or give any indication of Siberian dog breeds being transported elsewhere through trade. Choice D is incorrect because the text addresses the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads at Siberian sites starting about 2,000 years ago, suggesting only that the dogs and artifacts started to arrive in Siberia around that time; it doesn&rsquo;t suggest the purpose of this arrival and makes no mention of Siberian glass beads or other artifacts of Siberian origin.</p>",

According to the text, <em>A. mexicanus</em>, a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the fish live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river fish produce sounds that cave fish do not or vice versa.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text. The text says that there is little genetic difference between the river fish and the cave fish, not that the river fish and cave fish are so genetically distinct that they can be considered separate species. </p>",

According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.</p>",

The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage&mdash;such as access to phosphorus&mdash;from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don&rsquo;t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don&rsquo;t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn&rsquo;t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There&rsquo;s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn&rsquo;t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.</p>",

The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen&ouml;der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people&rsquo;s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people&rsquo;s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries&rsquo; varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>",

The text explains that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family descended from a single language (believed to have originated in what is now the US Southwest), resulting in similarities across the family&rsquo;s languages; however, the branches don&rsquo;t have similar vocabulary for maize, even though maize has been cultivated by all Uto-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest&mdash;the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family&rsquo;s origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize.

Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don&rsquo;t have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch&mdash;that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to the timing and source of maize acquisition wouldn&rsquo;t directly address the role of language. Furthermore, the text implies that southern Uto-Aztecan tribes probably acquired maize before the northern tribes did, given the evidence that maize originated in Mexico&mdash;the location of the best-known representative of the southern branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family&mdash;before spreading to the north.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of parthenogenesis as it relates to two California condors at the San Diego Zoo. The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo&rsquo;s California condors weren&rsquo;t similar enough to any of the zoo&rsquo;s male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn&rsquo;t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors&rsquo; mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo&rsquo;s condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn&rsquo;t support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that the zoo&rsquo;s female condors lacked sufficient access to males or that this would be a cause of parthenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosure included males.</p>",

The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi&rsquo;s progress is impeded.

The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis regarding this question&mdash;which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer&mdash;and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team&rsquo;s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team&rsquo;s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn&rsquo;t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team&rsquo;s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn&rsquo;t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn&rsquo;t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo&rsquo;s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo&rsquo;s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.</p>",

The philosopher states that when Aristotle builds his argument about the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that transgression, or violation of law, will ruin the state if it \"creeps in unperceived,\" or goes unnoticed. The philosopher then adds that Aristotle illustrates this point by comparing the situation to one in which small but frequent expenses diminish a fortune almost unnoticeably until, eventually, the fortune is entirely gone. In other words, the philosopher indicates that Aristotle makes the point that total obedience to law preserves a healthy state while even small violations, if ignored, will undermine the health of the state.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the philosopher addresses Aristotle&rsquo;s observation about corruption within the government (in particular, preventing the possibility that members of the government can take bribes), and although corruption can involve infractions, the observation is about a subset of people within the state and isn&rsquo;t directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law throughout the state. Choice C is incorrect because the philosopher discusses Aristotle&rsquo;s point about those who would intentionally destroy a constitution altogether and the need for rulers to remind the populace that it would be dangerous for a constitution to collapse, but neither idea is directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law. Choice D is incorrect because the philosopher explains that Aristotle makes the point that oligarchic leaders may retain power by having members of disenfranchised classes participate in government alongside governing classes, and this point doesn&rsquo;t address the importance of ensuring obedience to the law and addressing even minor violations.</p>",

Australian university staff members who took no leave from work during the study, took 2&ndash;4 days of leave, or took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration. After analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Jan Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about the effect of leave time on the attentiveness of university employees. According to the text, the researchers&rsquo; study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave, and a group who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who\ntook no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave with those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers&rsquo; conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of scholars&rsquo; understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn&rsquo;t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don&rsquo;t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn&rsquo;t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren&rsquo;t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have marketplaces, it wouldn&rsquo;t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don&rsquo;t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn&rsquo;t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn&rsquo;t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products. </p>",

It&rsquo;s logical to suggest that if the tusk serves such an important purpose for narwhals, the trait would be more common among them&mdash;specifically, that more narwhals would have a tusk.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no reason to think Laidre would say that if the tusk has the important function of helping narwhals detect when the water around them is about to freeze (meaning that it isn&rsquo;t always freezing), some narwhals would choose a different habitat altogether. Indeed, if it&rsquo;s true that the tusk helps narwhals avoid areas with dangerous conditions when they occur in their Arctic Ocean habitat, the tusk would likely enable the narwhals to continue living in that habitat rather than drive them elsewhere entirely. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on narwhals and makes no mention of other marine animals or how having a tusk might affect them. And if anything, it would be more logical to expect a very important trait to be more widespread, not less common, among other similar types of animals. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the scientists&rsquo; conclusion has anything to do with shyness. And because shyness and detection of the threat of freezing water aren&rsquo;t logically connected, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that Laidre would expect narwhals to become less shy over time if the tusk serves that important purpose.</p>",

However, he ironically suggests that this definition excludes mercy and forgiveness&mdash;qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is &ldquo;pitiless in her perfection&mdash;cold and stern and without mercy.&rdquo; This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as &ldquo;a woman of the very highest principles.&rdquo; However, it doesn&rsquo;t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such.

The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn&rsquo;t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused.

can enable sellers to capitalize on the heterogeneous values consumers assign to the same goods and services, but doing so requires careful messaging. Annie Peng Cui and Jennifer Wiggins recruited 171 participants (ages 18&ndash;60) online for an initial study and 83 students (ages 18&ndash;31) at a state university for a second study to test the effect of three different messages&mdash;&ldquo;pay what you can,&rdquo; &ldquo;pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo;&mdash;on how much participants would pay for concert tickets. Their results illustrate both the heterogeneity of consumer valuations and how sellers can benefit by prompting consumers to consider their own valuations: <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text about the effect of messaging on participative pricing. The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition than they do under both the \"pay what you can\" and the \"pay what you want\" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a finding that supports the idea that sellers can benefit when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the \"pay what you can\" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn&rsquo;t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it&rsquo;s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants&rsquo; valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets&rsquo; actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of the researchers&rsquo; findings about purple sea urchins and sunflower sea stars. The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn&rsquo;t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones. It doesn&rsquo;t suggest that sunflower sea stars generally prefer other marine animals that are more nutritious; there&rsquo;s no mention of other marine animals. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that sunflower sea stars are generally reluctant to feed on sea urchins. In fact, the text indicates that the sunflower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only the willingness of sunflower sea stars to consume the type of sea urchins found in barrens (nutritionally poor sea urchins), not how likely other species of sea stars are to consume them.</p>",

Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn&rsquo;t express that Odalie&rsquo;s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has &ldquo;quaint windows&rdquo; and a &ldquo;green and cool&rdquo; courtyard that is &ldquo;made musical&rdquo; by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds.

The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect.

The text begins by describing difrasismo, a device used in Classical Nahuatl poetry. The text then mentions the device&rsquo;s two functions: a formal one (giving structure to lines of verse) and a ritualistic one. The text indicates that the relation between the words in a difrasismo may appear tenuous without the additional information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture but that the meaning becomes intelligible in the context of that information. Therefore, the difrasismo&rsquo;s apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the two nouns used in a difrasismo are semantically equivalent; instead, the text indicates that the two nouns used in a difrasismo make up a single metaphor whose meaning is often intelligible only in the context of information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that there&rsquo;s a relationship between the formal function of the difrasismo and the difrasismo&rsquo;s intelligibility. Additionally, the text suggests that present-day readers who are familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture wouldn&rsquo;t find the difrasismo to be unintelligible. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the frequency of difrasismo&rsquo;s use in Classical Nahuatl is a necessary feature of intelligibility: the text indicates that an infrequently used difrasismo would presumably also be intelligible to members of an Aztec audience who are sufficiently familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991&ndash;1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996&ndash;2001 period it was four, and during the 2001&ndash;2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991&ndash;1995 and 2001&ndash;2008 periods; thus, it isn&rsquo;t true that the average numbers didn&rsquo;t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001&ndash;2008 period, not in the 1996&ndash;2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time&mdash;to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that economist Adam Smith&rsquo;s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term \"putatively,\" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn&rsquo;t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing \"putatively,\" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor&rsquo;s use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor&rsquo;s importance to Smith&rsquo;s work.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith&rsquo;s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith&rsquo;s metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text&rsquo;s emphasis on Smith&rsquo;s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith&rsquo;s metaphor, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the metaphor is a \"useful model\" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals&rsquo; selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith&rsquo;s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith&rsquo;s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views.</p>",

According to the text, the researcher hypothesized that Arctic ground squirrels would exhibit longer torpor bouts and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots do&mdash;or, put the other way, that the marmots would show shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the ground squirrels do. The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher&rsquo;s hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn&rsquo;t support the researcher&rsquo;s hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn&rsquo;t sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t support the researcher&rsquo;s hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn&rsquo;t address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals&rsquo; torpor bouts compared.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t support the researcher&rsquo;s hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn&rsquo;t sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. </p>",

Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots.</p>",

If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater efficiency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved efficiency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%&ndash;22% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more efficient than silicon-based cells are. Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less&mdash;not more than 29.5%&mdash;of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the effect of combining perovskite and silicon and the different parts of the solar spectrum that perovskite and silicon capture.</p>",

The text states that data gathered by the <em>Curiosity</em> rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars&rsquo;s surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hern&aacute;ndez et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) <em>was</em> present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from. Choice C is incorrect because the evidence described in the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that there were streams at the Murray Formation for an extended period and a lake for just a short time.

Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but <em>did</em> occasionally dry out.</p>",

Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue&mdash;a type of tissue that supports immune system function.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah&rsquo;s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic&mdash;namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average&mdash;which implies faster travel times between package destinations&mdash;would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections&mdash;both with and without dedicated left-turn signals&mdash;would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn&rsquo;t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher&rsquo;s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times.</p>",

The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun&rsquo;s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful&mdash;solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth&mdash;and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic&mdash;increased brightness in a particular region of the corona&mdash;comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun&rsquo;s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun&rsquo;s corona, which would not make logical sense.</p>",

According to the text, Jia Hu and colleagues \"hypothesized that workplace leaders who reflect on lessons learned from past mistakes are likely to exhibit more humility than leaders who don&rsquo;t engage in such reflection.\" The bar graph shows the humility scores for managers who participated in Jia Hu and colleagues&rsquo; study. It shows average humility scores for managers who reflected on a past mistake that they learned from, managers who reflected on a past mistake that they didn&rsquo;t learn from, and managers who were in the control group that, according to the text, simply reflected on their daily routines. The graph shows that managers who reflected on a past mistake they learned from received an average humility score between 3.0 and 3.5. Both the control group and managers who reflected on a mistake they didn&rsquo;t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reflected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it&rsquo;s true that none of the group&rsquo;s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups&rsquo; average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn&rsquo;t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reflected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reflected on a mistake they didn&rsquo;t learn from. Furthermore, the idea that the managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups did would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the graph that all three groups of participants exhibited less humility on average than the researchers expected. The graph and text don&rsquo;t cite any specific expectations that the researchers had with regard to the humility scores for each group.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, <em>A. brevis</em>, and its host insect, the <em>T. nylanderi</em> ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants&rsquo; share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study&rsquo;s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how <em>A. brevis</em> is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to <em>A. brevis</em> while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph&rsquo;s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph&rsquo;s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.</p>",

The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there&rsquo;s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don&rsquo;t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn&rsquo;t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn&rsquo;t weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn&rsquo;t undermine Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn&rsquo;t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.</p>",
